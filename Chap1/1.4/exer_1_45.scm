;We saw in section 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots
; by naively finding a fixed point of y  x/y does not converge
; , and that this can be fixed by average damping. 
; The same method works for finding cube roots
;  as fixed points of the average-damped y -> x/y2.
;   Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots 
;   -- a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search 
;   for y -> x/y3 converge. 
;   On the other hand, 
;   if we average damp twice 
;   (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of y -> x/y3) 
;   the fixed-point search does converge. 
;   Do some experiments to determine how many average damps 
;   are required to compute nth roots 
;as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of y -> x/yn-1. 
;Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing nth roots 
;using fixed-point, average-damp, and the repeated procedure of exercise 1.43. 
;Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are available as primitives.

;based on above experiments looks like we need dampingfreq to be a logartithm function of
;n where nth-root for n is calculated . we can redefined nth-root as 


(define (nth-root-redefined x n )
  (define dampingfreq (floor (/ (log n ) (log 2))))
  (fixed-point ((repeated average-damp dampingfreq) (lambda (y) (/ x ( expt y (- n 1)))))
