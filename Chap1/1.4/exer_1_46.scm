;Several of the numerical methods described in this chapter are instances of an 
;extremely general computational strategy known as iterative improvement. Iterative 
;improvement says that, to compute something, we start with an initial guess for the 
;answer, test if the guess is good enough, and otherwise improve the guess and 
;continue the process using the improved guess as the new guess. Write a procedure 
;iterative-improve that takes two procedures as arguments: a method for telling 
;whether a guess is good enough and a method for improving a guess. Iterative-improve 
;should return as its value a procedure that takes a guess as argument and keeps 
;improving the guess until it is good enough. Rewrite the sqrt procedure of section 
;1.1.7 and the fixed-point procedure of section 1.3.3 in terms of iterative-improve.

(define (iterative-improve good-enuf? improve-guess)
  (define ( try guess) 
    (if (good-enuf? guess)
         guess
        (try (improve-guess guess))))
  try)


;; below is what we have in section 1.17 for sqrt
;(define (sqrt-iter guess x) (if (good-enough? guess x)
;      guess
;      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
;(define (improve guess x) (average guess (/ x guess)))
;where
;(define (average x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))
;We also have to say what we mean by “good enough.” 
;(define (good-enough? guess x)
;(< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
;
; 
;Finally, we need a way to get started. 
;(define (sqrt x) (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))

;; lets try to define what good-enuf is in the iterative-improve method first
;;good-enuf is a procedure which takes guess as an argument 
;; and says whether it is good enuf
